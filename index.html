            <p>Hi! And welcome to my personal portfolio page!  My name is Andrew Mayerchak, I'm a 29-year old military vet who's had a blast flying jet aircraft for the past 7 years!  I'm looking to transition careers at the moment, and I've always loved computers since I was a kid!  (1990's baby!)  For the past 10 years I've dabbled in some Python, and even took a few Comp Sci classes back in college.  I'm looking now to further my skills into somehting more professional, and desinged this site to reflect my knowledge for you potential employers out there looking for the right candidate!</p>
